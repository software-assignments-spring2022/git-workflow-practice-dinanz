## [Rumours of 2008 game MGS3 remake: what does that entail?](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2021/10/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-virtuos)

There have been a few remours circulating the web regarding Japanese game production studio [Konami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami)'s potential remake of the third (and one of the most popular) installment of the classic Metal Gear Solid series, [MGS3 Snake Eater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater). Indeed while this **_[article](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2021/10/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-virtuos)_** is based on an "unannounced remake", it holds some potential truth as a MGS3 remake could possibly and very likely bring in significant revenue to Konami. Though this news/rumour is a few months old, it has indeed been 18 years since the original game itself was released, and 7 years since the [last installment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_V:_The_Phantom_Pain) of the MGS series. What interests me isn't whether MGS3 is actually going to get a remake, but rather how it's going to be remade, as well as whether [Fox engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Engine) may make a comeback.

While I am by no means an expert on game engine or even video games, I have had a great experience with [MGSV GZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_V:_Ground_Zeroes) and MGSV TPP, both of which used the Fox engine, which was developed by Konami and released in 2014. The games are clearly well-optimised given its very quick loading time and zero lag, and the graphics are realistic to an extreme, though game physics are a bit wonky (mostly due to predetermined settings). However, even though Fox engine was praised as one of the best while it was still in use, Konami discontinued its use in 2021, which was quite a shame as agreed by MG fans. If MGS3 were to be remade, Fox may make a comeback as well with renewed development, however that seems very unlikely.

What's even more curious is how MGS3 might be remade. Given that the game is a 18-year-old "relic of the past" and released for Playstation2, many elements of the game, especially graphics and elements of the gameplay such as object physics, are outdated and must be almost completely renewed in order to match today's game standards. Given what we've learned (and are going to learn) about scalability and platform independence, it's interesting to think about how the developers may choose what parts of the game to modify and which ones to redo completely from scratch. If the remake were to release on PC as well given the growing capabilities of a PC as a gaming platform, remaking efforts would have to take that into account for development and budget as well.
